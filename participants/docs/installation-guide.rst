Software Installation and Deployment
------------------------------------

The NONRTRIC rApp Manager requires several other functions to be installed and configured to operate correctly. Therefore it should be installed as part of an Integrated SMO installation. 

For more information on installation of Non-RT RIC and SMO components in Kubernetes using Helm, see `Deploy NONRTRIC in Kubernetes <nonrtricwikik8s_>`_.
