### Generate rApp package

rApp package generator script takes the directory name as an argument and generates the rApp package with the contents inside the given directory.

#### Generating in Linux environment

> ./generate.sh rapp-all


#### Generating in Windows environment

> generate.bat rapp-all


This should generate rApp package named after the directory with the extension of .csar(e.g., rapp-all.csar) and it is placed parallel to the script.
